In this repo you will find jupyter notebooks that used to be in the main repo [**deep**doctection](https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection). 

In addition, the repo contains a folder with examples that are used in the notebooks. 

The following notebooks are stored:

[Get_Started.ipynb](Get_Started.ipynb): 
- Introduction to **deep**doctection
- Analyzer 
- Output structure.

[Datasets_and_Eval.ipynb](Datasets_and_Eval.ipynb): 
- Creation of custom datasets
- Evaluation
- Fine tuning models

[Custom_Pipeline.ipynb](Custom_Pipeline.ipynb): 
- Model catalog and registries
- Predictors
- Pipeline backbones
- Pipelines.

[Using_LayoutLM_for_sequence_classification.ipynb](Using_LayoutLM_for_sequence_classification.ipynb): 
- Fine tuning LayoutLM for sequence classification on a custom dataset
- Evaluation 
Building and running a production pipeline 

[Running_pre_trained_models_from_other_libraries.ipynb](Running_pre_trained_models_from_other_libraries.ipynb)
- Installing and running pre-trained models provided by Layout-Parser
- Adding new categories

To use the notebooks **deep**doctection must be installed.
